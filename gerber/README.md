# NOTES
Download the Statial.b Gerber file by selecting the Statial-b_v02-03_Gerber.zip link listed above.<br/>
Then select the "download raw file" icon in upper right.<br/><br/>

From there go to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/?from=PyottDesign) and upload the Statial Gerber zip file by selecting the "add gerber file" button. The Gerber file contains both the main board and the middle mouse button sub-board connected by break away tabs so **make sure to set "Different Design" to 2.** Select your prefered board color (or leave default green). All other settings can be left as a default 2-layer 1.6mm thick.
