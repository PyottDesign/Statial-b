# Statial.b Adjustable Mouse
Please check [Statial.b Youtube build](youtube) and the [Statial.b Instructions PDF](statial-b_instructions_v01-00.pdf) for more info on this project.

The Statial.b is an open source DIY mouse design. This concept has adjustable surfaces that can be moved and locked in position to create a wide range of ergonomics for any grip style. Files for ambidextrous builds are included.

Knowledge of 3D printing, basic electronics & soldering skills as well as the ability to upload code to an Arduino are needed for this build. The design is based around a 16,000 DPI optical sensor in the PMW3389 and driven by an Arduino compatible Pro Micro controller.

This is a fairly complex project. I tried to cover all the assembly details in the in the instructions PDF and on YouTube, but some problem solving skills are still going to be required.

The finished design is a functioning prototype that requires a lot of adjusting to get it dialed in and is more fragile than a normal commercially produced product. It’s also a heavy mouse weighing up to a hefty 130 grams (depending on components used). All that said, it works great and is super fun to use. There’s really nothing else like it out there if you’re looking to explore mouse ergonomics.

All 3D printed parts need to be made in a “Tough” or “ABS like” resin material. Resin print color is up to you. ***This project requires resin printed parts. 
It will not work if parts are 3D printed with the FDM process.***

Current (2024) project materials costs are around $200 (not including tools). This is a rough guess so you have an idea of what you’re getting into.

# Configurations
Modern mouse grip styles have grown out of players adapting to the shape of a mouse. The Statial.b creates the opportunity for new mouse shapes to grow out of grip styles. Below are some common grip type configurations for the Statial.b as starting points for further adjustment. 

### PALM
When fully collapsed the Statial.b is slightly smaller than a normal high performance mouse. Surfaces can be moved out significantly for larger hands.

### STUBNOSE CLAW
Unlike a normal mouse, the buttons on the Statial.b can pitch forward for different grip types. This allows claw grip users to position buttons perpendicular to pressing motion.

### BACKLESS FINGER
Surfaces can be configured to experiment with alternate grip methods. Finger grip users can remove back surface entirely.

### VERTICAL
Surfaces can be configured to +50° angle to mimic the fit of a vertical mouse. Fixed ends of rear surface arms can be extended or longer sections of tube can be cut for even steeper angles.
