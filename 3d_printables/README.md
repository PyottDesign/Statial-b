# NOTES
Above STL, Lychee and Formlabs zip files are copies of most recent versions of all the 3D printable parts in various formats. Prints only tested in resin printers, FDMs probably won't work on this one. Recommend Fromlabs Tough 2000 or Anycubic ABS-Like Pro 2 resins<br/>Sunlu, Resione or Siraya equivalent are probably all good.<br/>
Cutting jig and parts for left handed builds are in the extras folder in the STL zip file. Previous versions of parts are saved as individual zipped files in the /archive/.
<br/><br/>
The STEP.zip contains a single surface model file of the entire design for editing in CAD. This file can be ignored if you are just looking to print a copy of the Statial.b.

# CHANGELOG
* _rear_SBv10A02_qty-01.STL_ - Decreased length of rear surface for better range of motion / improves top ball socket lock screw access.
