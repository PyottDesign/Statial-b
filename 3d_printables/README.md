# NOTES
Above STL, Lychee and Formlabs zip files contain most recent versions of all the 3D printable parts. Prints only tested in resin printers, FDMs probably won't work on this one. Recommend Fromlabs Tough 2000 or Anycubic ABS-Like Pro 2 resins. Sunlu, Resione or Siraya equivalent are probably all good.<br/>
Cutting jig and parts for left handed builds are in the extras folder in the STL zip file. Previous versions of parts are saved as individual zipped files in the /archive/.

# CHANGELOG
* _rear_SBv10A02_qty-01.STL_ - Decreased length of rear surface for better range of motion / improves top ball socket lock screw access.
